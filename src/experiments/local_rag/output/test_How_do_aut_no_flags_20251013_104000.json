  "answer": "Autonomous agents fundamentally transform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows by introducing dynamic, adaptive, and autonomous capabilities that overcome the limitations of traditional RAG. Traditional RAG systems operate on a static 'retrieve-then-generate' paradigm, which lacks the flexibility to handle complex, multi-step tasks and real-time adaptation. In contrast, Agentic RAG integrates autonomous AI agents that leverage patterns such as reflection (self-correction), planning (task decomposition), tool use (selecting appropriate tools for specific steps), and multi-agent collaboration (coordinated problem-solving). This enables agents to dynamically manage retrieval strategies, iteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows in response to task complexity and environmental changes. Consequently, Agentic RAG achieves greater flexibility, scalability, and context-awareness, making it suitable for diverse and challenging applications.",

        "final_answer": "Autonomous agents fundamentally transform RAG workflows through three core innovations: (1) Dynamic tool orchestration replaces static retrieval components with adaptive decision-making capabilities, allowing agents to select optimal tools (databases, APIs, calculators) per query; (2) Iterative refinement loops enable continuous improvement through reflection and re-planning, overcoming traditional RAG's linear 'retrieve-generate' limitation; (3) Memory systems maintain context across multi-step interactions, supporting long-horizon tasks that traditional RAG cannot handle. These transformations address key limitations of conventional RAG including rigid retrieval strategies, lack of adaptability, and inability to handle complex, multi-step reasoning tasks."
