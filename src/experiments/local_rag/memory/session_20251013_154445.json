The implementation of this pattern has evolved significantly\nwith advancements like GPT-4’s function calling capabilities and systems capable of managing access to numerous\ntools. These developments facilitate sophisticated workflows where agents autonomously select and execute the most\nrelevant tools for a given task.\nWhile tool use significantly enhances agentic workflows, challenges remain in optimizing the selection of tools,\nparticularly in contexts with a large number of available options. Techniques inspired by retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG), such as heuristic-based selection, have been proposed to address this issue.\n3.4 Multi-Agent\nMulti-agent collaboration [ 29] is a key design pattern in agentic workflow\n\n[Document 2 - Source: Agentic RAG.pdf]\ngmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a solution, enhancing LLMs by\nintegrating real-time data retrieval to provide contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. Despite\nits promise, traditional RAG systems are constrained by static workflows and lack the adaptability\nrequired for multi-step reasoning and complex task management.\nAgentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) transcends these limitations by embedding\nautonomous AI agents into the RAG pipeline. These agents leverage agentic design patterns reflec-\ntion, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration to dynamically manage retrieval strategies,\niteratively refine contextual understanding, and adapt workflows through clearly defined operational\nstructures ranging from sequential steps to adaptive collaboration. This integration enables Agentic\nRAG systems to deliver unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and context-awareness across diverse\napplications.\nThis survey provides a comprehensive exploration of Agen\n\n[Document 3 - Source: Agentic RAG.pdf]\ntual understanding, and iteratively refine responses.\nThe evolution of agents [12] has significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI systems. Modern agents, including\nLLM-powered and mobile agents [13], are intelligent entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and autonomously\nexecuting tasks. These agents leverage agentic patterns, such as reflection [14], planning [15], tool use, and multi-agent\ncollaboration [16], to enhance decision-making and adaptability.\nFurthermore, these agents employ agentic workflow patterns [ 12,13], such as prompt chaining, routing, parallelization,\norchestrator-worker models, and evaluator-optimizer , to structure and optimize task execution. By integrating these\npatterns, Agentic RAG systems can efficiently manage dynamic workflows and address complex problem-solving\nscenarios. The convergence of RAG and agentic intelligence has given rise to Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(Agentic RAG) [ 14], a paradigm that integrates agents into the RAG pipel",

The evaluation is based on the provided documents, which contain the relevant information. The agent's response is incomplete as it only states the first step of its reasoning process without drawing a conclusion or synthesizing the findings from the tool observation.",

For example, it should state that according to the documents, autonomous agents transform RAG by embedding agentic design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration) into the pipeline, allowing for dynamic management of retrieval strategies, iterative refinement of context, and adaptable workflows, which overcomes the static nature of traditional RAG.",
