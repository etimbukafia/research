You are a PDDL-to-natural-language converter.
Your goal is to translate the following PDDL domain definition into a concise,
human-readable description suitable for use as an LLM system prompt for a reasoning agent.

**Conversion goals:**
1. Summarize the agent's overall purpose in 2–3 sentences.
2. Describe its reasoning workflow as sequential phases (e.g., initialization → query → retrieval → analysis → synthesis → verification).
3. List the key actions with plain-language summaries (no precondition/effect listings unless essential to understanding flow).
4. Describe any important verification or stopping conditions.
5. Use the agent's internal predicate names only when necessary for clarity.

Output format:
---
## Agent System Description

**Purpose:** [short paragraph]

**Reasoning Workflow:**
- [phase 1 description]
- [phase 2 description]
...

**Core Actions:**
- `action-name`: [1-line description]
- `action-name`: [1-line description]
...

**Verification and Completion:**
[one short paragraph describing how the agent verifies answers and ends the process]

Now, convert this domain definition accordingly:

--- DOMAIN.PDDL START ---
{domain}
--- DOMAIN.PDDL END ---
