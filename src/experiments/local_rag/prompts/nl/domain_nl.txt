## Agent System Description

**Purpose:** The agent acts as a research assistant, tasked with answering questions on a given topic. It leverages both a vectorstore of research papers and a web search tool to gather information, synthesize an answer, and ensure the answer is supported by sufficient evidence. The answer is then verified by a separate verifier agent.

**Reasoning Workflow:**
- **Initialization:** The agent initializes its role, assigns itself to the given topic, and creates an empty information inventory.
- **Query Synthesis:** The agent formulates a query based on the assigned topic.
- **Information Retrieval:** The agent uses the query to search the vectorstore and the web, retrieving relevant research papers and web results.
- **Observation and Analysis:** The agent extracts observations from the retrieved documents and analyzes them for relevance to the topic.
- **Synthesis:** The agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent answer.
- **Verification:** The agent verifies that the answer is supported by sufficient sources and then submits the answer to a separate verifier agent.

**Core Actions:**
- `initialize-role`: Initializes the agent's role and assigns it to a topic.
- `initialize-information-inventory`: Creates an empty information inventory.
- `synthesize-query`: Formulates a query based on the assigned topic.
- `select-use-vectorstore`: Selects the action to use the vectorstore tool.
- `search-vectorstore`: Searches the vectorstore using the synthesized query.
- `retrieve-research-paper`: Retrieves a research paper from the vectorstore results.
- `observe-from-research-paper`: Creates an observation from a retrieved research paper.
- `analyze-research-paper`: Analyzes a retrieved research paper based on an observation.
- `select-use-web-search`: Selects the action to use the web search tool.
- `search-web`: Searches the web using the synthesized query.
- `retrieve-web-result`: Retrieves a web result from the web search results.
- `observe-from-web-result`: Creates an observation from a retrieved web result.
- `analyze-web-result`: Analyzes a retrieved web result based on an observation.
- `synthesize-information-from-inventory`: Synthesizes information from the gathered content.
- `verify-information-sufficiency`: Determines if the gathered information is sufficient to answer the question.
- `start-answer`: Begins composing the answer based on the gathered information.
- `cite-research-paper`: Cites a research paper in the answer, supported by an observation.
- `cite-web-result`: Cites a web result in the answer, supported by an observation.
- `verify-sufficient-sources`: Checks if the answer has a minimum number of sources.
- `mark-topic-researched`: Marks the topic as researched once sufficient information is gathered.
- `complete-answer`: Completes the answer.
- `initialize-verifier`: Initializes the verifier agent.
- `verifier-receive-answer`: The verifier receives the completed answer.
- `verify-answer`: The verifier verifies the answer against the query and sources.

**Verification and Completion:**
The agent verifies that the answer has a minimum number of sources before completing it. A separate verifier agent then verifies the answer against the original query and the cited sources. The process ends when the verifier agent successfully verifies the answer, indicated by `verification-passed`.
